# Hospitality-Dashboard

With guidance from Codebasics, I built this comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, Realization %, and ADR across various properties and cities. 
This project helped me deepen my understanding of data visualization and analytics, and I'm thrilled with the insights it provides. Check out the detailed breakdowns and trends over the weeks!.
